Drop. It. Now.
Your time is out.
It's hopeless.
Odds are against you. Evens - too.
Crying won't get you nowhere.
It's beyond me, how you ended up here.
Won't work.
You can't seriously think this is gonna fly!
You should reconsider.
I strongly advise against it.
You chance of success are minuscule.
Not worth the effort.
Abandon all hope.
You should plan better.
I won't lie to you, your cause is almost hopeless.
Nah.
That's just doomed to fail.
Care for a wager that your plan won't last?
No way.
Think again.
Highly unlikely.
Things like this rarely work out.
Don't even try.
Your plan so has no point, it's literally blunt.
Out of question.
