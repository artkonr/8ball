You know how they say "don't drop the ball"? Well, too late for you.
You had a greater chance of winning your high-school crush.
Does your family know you're such a disgrace?
Find me another owner, please.
There's nothing like delivering bad news. So bad news for you.
It's a good thing you can't behead me for bad news.
To think I thought it couldn't get any worse.
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.
You still here?
My wisdom tells me you have no wisdom.
Try again later. Or don't. I don't care.
Like anybody cares?
Only <<almighty entity of your choice>> can get you out now.
That was lame.
Oh, for crying out loud...
OK, you've messed it up, now what?
Put me down, I'm too shocked to comment.
Go break a mirror, it may even improve things a bit.
Cheer up, it's not that bad. Oh, I'm not talking to you, of course...
I know you're screwed, but you still cling to hope.
Just so you know, I've never believed in you, not for a second.
How do you spell "failure"?
Damage's done.
You poor sod.
Worst state of matters possible.
