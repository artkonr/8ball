Hm, we may be going a bridge too far...
You sure? 'Cause I'm not.
Your plan seems suspiciously fragile.
Maybe, it'll work, but will it last?
Doesn't sound like a sound investment.
Are you kidding?
Hm, I like your positive attitude...
If I started to list all the "but"s here, you'd think I stutter.
Like things never go wrong...
I respect the Murphy's law, and you should too.
Your plan lacks resiliency.
This is... daring.
Sometimes success is not everything. Unless of course you're really counting on it.
Wake me up when you get more input.
Can't tell for certain. You?
Just make sure you have a fallback plan, there's a good chap.
Tread carefully.
For what it's worth, you may be on the verge of screwing up.
Have faith. You'll need it.
Err... I guess?..
